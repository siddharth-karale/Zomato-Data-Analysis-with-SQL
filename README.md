# Zomato-Data-Analysis-with-SQL

This project explores the Zomato dataset using SQL queries to answer various questions about users, purchases and other aspects.

**Installation:**

1. Create tables and add the data in SQL from tables file.
2. Access the Zomato data from tables.sql file.

**Usage:**
